## Scope of Work
With a growing family and a need for space, our family decided to analyze data and determine whether we should buy a home and if so, where should we purchase. For this personal project, 100 Excel spreadsheets containing property sales data published by the New York City [Department of Finance](https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-annualized-sales-update.page) were collected, cleaned and transformed using Python and Pandas then use Streamlit and Altair to generate a dashboard visualizing trends. 

A Jupyter notebook reading and cleaning the Excel data can be found [here](/notebooks/Read_and_Clean_NYC_Property_Sales_Data_from_2003_to_2022.ipynb).

## Tools and Technologies
* Pandas - Used to process spreadsheets and produce figures to chart 
* Streamlit - Used to develop the dashboard with filters and charts
* Altair - Used to generate charts vizualizating sales metrics

## Future Work
Potential next steps in the future could be:
* Join with relevant demographics data to anaylse trends between datasets
* Add NYC maps visualization 
* Join with NYC PLUTO data to get additional data on properties
